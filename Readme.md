# FinSight AI üîêü§ñ
### The World's First Zero-Knowledge Multi-Agentic Financial AI


"Your AI Financial Team That Never Sees Your Data"

FinSight AI is an multi-agentic AI system for the 30-hour Agentic Day Google Hackathon, delivering personalized financial guidance with absolute privacy through user-controlled encryption and zero-knowledge architecture. Powered by the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), it integrates seamlessly with Fi Money for real-time financial data analysis.

### The Breakthrough
**Problem** : Traditional financial AI compromises privacy by accessing sensitive data.
Solution: VaultGPT leverages Google ADK to orchestrate specialized AI agents that analyze encrypted financial data using homomorphic encryption, ensuring zero-knowledge processing.

**Result**: Personalized financial advice, investment recommendations, and crisis planning without exposing your data.

## üéØ Agent Development Guide
Creating a New Agent
Each agent is defined in its own folder with agent.py, tools.py, and __init__.py. Here's an example for the Investment Agent:
investment/__init__.py
### This file makes the folder a Python package

investment/agent.py
```python
from google.adk import Agent, tool
from .tools import get_stock_price

class InvestmentAgent(Agent):
    name = "investment_agent"
    model = "gemini-2.0-pro"
    instructions = "Analyze market data and provide investment advice."
    tools = [get_stock_price]
```
investment/tools.py
```python
import requests
  
@tool
def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> float:
    # Replace with actual API call
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/stock/{ticker}")
    data = response.json()
    return data['price']
```
Orchestration Integration
The Orchestration Agent routes queries to the appropriate subagents. Here's how it's structured:

orchestration/agent.py
```python
from google.adk import LlmAgent
from ..investment import InvestmentAgent
from ..emergency import EmergencyAgent

investment_agent = InvestmentAgent()
emergency_agent = EmergencyAgent()

orchestration_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="orchestration_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-pro",
    instructions="Route user queries to the appropriate specialist agent.",
    sub_agents=[investment_agent, emergency_agent]
)
```


üîê Security Implementation
Custom Encryption Logic
```javascript 
// src/services/encryption.js
class EncryptionAgent {
  async encryptWithPasscode(data, passcode) {
    const customKey = await this.generateCustomKey(passcode);
    const encryptedData = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
      { name: "AES-GCM", iv: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12)) },
      customKey,
      new TextEncoder().encode(data)
    );
    return encryptedData;
  }

  async generateCustomKey(passcode) {
    return crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
      { name: "PBKDF2", salt: new Uint8Array(16), iterations: 100000, hash: "SHA-256" },
      await crypto.subtle.importKey("raw", new TextEncoder().encode(passcode), "PBKDF2", false, ["deriveKey"]),
      { name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 },
      false,
      ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
    );
  }
}
```
